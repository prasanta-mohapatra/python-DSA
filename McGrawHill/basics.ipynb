    "Performance: Compared to lower-level languages like C or C++, Python can be slower in terms of execution speed. Python's interpreted nature and dynamic typing introduce some overhead, which can impact performance for computationally intensive tasks. However, with proper optimization and by utilizing external libraries or writing performance-critical code in other languages, this limitation can often be mitigated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): The Global Interpreter Lock is a mechanism in CPython (the reference implementation of Python) that allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time. This can limit the parallel execution of multiple threads in CPU-bound tasks. However, it's important to note that the GIL primarily affects CPU-bound tasks and does not significantly impact I/O-bound or asynchronous tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mobile and Game Development: While Python can be used for mobile app development and game development, it is not as commonly used as languages like Java, Swift, or C# in these domains. Python's performance limitations and limited support for mobile platforms or game engines may restrict its suitability for certain types of mobile or game development projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory Consumption: Python's dynamic typing and high-level abstractions can result in increased memory consumption compared to statically typed languages. This can be a concern in resource-constrained environments or applications that need to handle large-scale data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Packaging and Distribution: Packaging and distributing Python applications with their dependencies can sometimes be a bit challenging. Managing and resolving dependencies, ensuring compatibility across different platforms, and creating standalone executable files can require additional effort and tooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited Mobile and Web Browser Support: Python is not a natively supported language for mobile platforms or web browsers. While there are frameworks like Kivy or BeeWare that allow Python-based mobile app development, the ecosystem and tooling options are more limited compared to other languages like Java, Kotlin, Swift, or JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "Less Ideal for Low-Level System Programming: Python's high-level nature and garbage collection make it less suitable for low-level system programming tasks, such as writing operating systems or device drivers. Lower-level languages like C or C++ are generally preferred for these types of projects."

    "An identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module, or any other user-defined object in a program. It is a sequence of characters consisting of letters (both lowercase and uppercase), digits, and underscores (_). Identifiers are used to provide a unique name or label to different elements of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main differences between variables, identifiers, and keywords are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables: In programming, a variable is a named storage location used to hold a value. It is created using an identifier and assigned a value that can be changed during the program execution. Variables are used to store and manipulate data in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifiers: An identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module, or any other user-defined object. It provides a unique label or name to different elements in a program. Identifiers follow certain rules, such as starting with a letter or underscore, and they cannot be a reserved keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keywords: Keywords are predefined words in a programming language that have a specific meaning and purpose. These words are reserved and cannot be used as identifiers. Keywords are used to define the syntax and structure of the programming language. Examples of keywords in Python include \"if,\" \"for,\" \"while,\" \"def,\" and \"class.\"\n",
